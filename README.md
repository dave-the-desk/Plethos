# Plethos
personal project in data analysis

Nov 14

Plethos is a web scraping algorithm that uses Selenium and BS4 to process data on congressional stock trades and utilize SQLite as the backend database.

This is an ongoing project that I work on in my free time, I plan to implement Sentiment Analysis using NLTK and cloud computing using AWS
